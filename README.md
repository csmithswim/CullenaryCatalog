### How The Application Works ###

* Spring Boot and dependencies such as Spring Data, Spring Web and Validation work in tandem to run a web server to process incoming API requests and respond accordingly.
* JDBC and Spring's MYSQL driver facilitate a MYSQL server to be run and managed by JDBC and unique implementations of JDBC's Crud Repository.
* Lombok eliminates much of the boilerplate code in the Recipe model class.
